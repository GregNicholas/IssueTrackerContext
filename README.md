## Overview

This app is an issue tracking system, created so that an individual or members of a team can keep track of issues related to a project they are working on.

**_NOTE on refactoring_** After a review of the app, I realized I had not fixed an issue with state management. When the IssuesContext was added to the app, I had used a bare bones functionality to take advantage of the Context API, but I used a "hacky" way of updating data while I focused on making the app functional. I have now added the reducer and refactored IssuesContext to make the code cleaner.

## Requirements/Features

- In the app, a user must be able sign up/login in order to view or add issues. - Authentication is set up using firebase, email, username and password sign up, log in
  with email, log out, and update profile.

- User must be able to create new issues, and edit/delete issues they have created.
  -There is a popup modal to confirm deletions.
- A user may comment on other issues as well, and only delete their own comments.
- Admin users may edit or delete any issues
- Issue form has fields for title and description. There are select dropdowns list to select issue type, category, and assignee. Radio buttons to set prioriity. Due date can be chosen
- Issues are displayed in a sortable table. Key info is visible on the table with color coding for urgency. Items are clickable to display more detail.
- There are simple charts to display quick statistics
- Data is updated in real time and stored in the firebase firestore database.
- The app is responsive to work on desktop or mobile devices. Collapsable navbar for smaller screens
- The form component is reusable for both Add and Edit functions.

### Built with

  at the top of the screen or in a closable side nav
